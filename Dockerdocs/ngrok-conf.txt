use ngrok app for GIT SCM polling .

On git hub webhook it does not support localhost settings the jenkins which run on local host prt 8080

so we get a url from ngrok which is forward to local host
now update that link in github webhook
<ngrok link>/github-webhook/



run 
ngrok https 8080

a forwading url will be created.
